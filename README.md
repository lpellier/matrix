## Getting Started
The aim of this project is to code a Matrix and Vector class in C++. 

These classes contain helper methods such as transpose, determinant, inverse etc... 

It also provides operator overloads for scaling, adding, substracting and multiplying vectors and matrices.

I also wrote a test scripts with unit tests to make sure everything's right.

### Installation
`git clone https://github.com/lpellier/matrix.git && cd matrix`

## Usage

Include the general header file in your code and that's it.
